An eagle breaks the silence
And overflies the field
My eyes will try to follow 'til
It vanishes away
Like candles in the darkness
We fight against the wind
Devotion to your idols soon
Will overthrow the king
Out of order, taming borders
Tearing down the fences
On and on and after all
The century has gone
Racist jumble, turbulence
My eyes believe
We have gone to the end
(Ordinary Earth)
Ordinary Earth
Sailing throught the space
Population alienation
Losing all affection
Calling on to heaven's hope
To watch for my protection
Out of luck, potential stuck
Remote controlled
By the TV again
Carries human souls
(Carries human souls)
Lead us the journey of our fate (ah)
So come (so come)
Millennium sun (Millennium sun)
Won't you show us the way?
Future's begun
So words (so words)
From my mouth come (from my mouth come)
Whispering for your return
Pictures, a sunset on the lake
Mirrors of crystal, your portrait
Walking on this field
While I wait
So come (so come)
Millennium sun (Millennium sun)
Won't you show us the way?
Future's begun
So words (so words)
From my mouth come (from my mouth come)
Whispering for your return
Show us the future's began
Burning millennium
Sun
