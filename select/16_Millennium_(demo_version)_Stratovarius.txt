Look at yourself but don't be afraid
You have much more than you see
Preaching yourself, you're a fool
And you fear the way of the world on your back

There is no end to all this madness
There is no hope for us at all

Millennium - Where will we go?
Oblivion - Time will show
(...) - Following me through the [years]

Millennium - There is a way
[To stadium] - I show the way
(...) - You should avoid at all cost

Find your own way, forget all the bad
See what the future will bring
There is no way to go back anymore
Eons shoot out through the space

There is no end to all this madness
There is no hope for us at all

Millennium - Where will we go?
Oblivion - Time will show
(...) - Following me through the [years]

Millennium - There is a way
[To stadium] - I show the way
(...) - You should avoid at all cost
