Kings and priests, aliens and strangers
We must avoid the dangers

Kings and priests of Americana don't spread the hysteria
Perpetuate the flow while the righteous ones go
And we'll keep rocking through double-zero meltdown
And when we run for cover, tell the night to end it's smother
When the world fades away, we'll be free to break away
Transcending to another plain
And know, just know, He's destinating our fate

Enter all into the millennium
Time's last song has just been sung
Though reality is that we've yet begun
Enter all into the millennium
