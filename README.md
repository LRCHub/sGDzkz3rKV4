# Robbie Williams – Millennium

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
We've got stars
directing our fate
And we're praying
it's not too late
Millennium
Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
but we've been
making money since
the day that we were born
Got to slow down
cause we'll low down
Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Till we find ourselves a partner
someone to Relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down
We've got stars
directing our fate
And we're praying
it's not too late
'cause we know
we're falling from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction
detox for your rent
Overdose at Christmas
and give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical
refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness
cause we know
we're gonna fade away
We've got stars
directing our fate
And we're praying
it's not too late
'cause we know
we're falling from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go
if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go
if you think you are hard enough
Millennium, Millennium
We've got stars
directing our fate
And we're praying
it's not too late
'cause we know
we're falling from grace
Millennium
Sometimes you know
And when we come
we always come too late
I often think
that we were born to hate
get up and see
the sarcasm in my eyes
And when we come
we always come too late
I often think
that we were born to hate
Get up and see
the sarcasm in my eyes
We've got stars
directing our fate
Millennium and we're praying
it's not too late
Millennium
And we won't stop
We've got stars
directing our fate
and we're praying
it's not too late
'cause we know we're falling
from grace Millennium fades
